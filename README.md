## Features

- Escape snippet special characters
- Snippet tab stop helper
- Able to reset tab stop counter
- Provide an intuitive way to create a snippet
- The extension will help to translate the user-friendly snippet syntax to Visual Studio Code native snippet

## How to use

After you installed this extension, you have a snippet to help you to create other snippets. <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> create a new file and type `skel`, press <kbd>tab</kbd>, you will have a snippet skeleton. Press <kbd>tab</kbd> to fill the *name*, *scope*, *prefix* and *body* of your snippet. Below is an example:

```
Name: keyboard HTML markup - describing shortcuts on web
Prefix: kkk
----------------------------------------
<kbd>ctrl</kbd>
```

Here I didn't specify the *scope* for this snippet, so it is a global snippet and will be available for all file types.

Optionally, I can select the text `ctrl` between `<kbd>` and `</kbd>` and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>. Now the text `ctrl` will be automatically changed to `${10:ctrl}`. Next time when you press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> again, you will get an tab stop with counter 20 like this `${20:some_text}`. The idea is that you can easily create tab stops with an increment of 10. This makes it easy for you to modify you snippet later for example add a new tab stop `${15:}` between `${10:}` and `${20:}`. This will be very hard if you are using continous tab stop counters. 

Another feature this extension provides is escape special snippet characters. Manually invoke this feature by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and type `edde`.

When you finished editing the snippet, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd>, a snippet file will be created in the snippets folder.

Note that, if the shortcuts do not work, you can always press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and type `edde` to call the commands provided by this extension manually. Optionally you can specify your own shortcuts for them.
